Herd psychology refers to the tendency of individuals to adopt behaviors, beliefs, 
or actions based on the influence or behavior of a larger group, rather than through 
personal analysis or independent decision-making. This phenomenon is often seen in 
situations where people follow the actions of the majority, even if they may not fully 
understand or agree with them. It can be driven by a desire to conform, fear of missing out, 
or a belief that the group has more information or wisdom. While herd psychology can l
ead to positive outcomes in some cases, such as coordinated actions or collective 
problem-solving, it can also result in negative behaviors like market bubbles, social panics, o
r the spread of misinformation. Understanding herd psychology is important in fields like 
economics, sociology, and behavioral science.
